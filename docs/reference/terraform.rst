Terraform module
================

.. TODO: Add technical details and information about any Terraform modules used in this repo.
         Remove if there is no Terraform module in the repo.
         You don't necessarily need to copy the Terraform module into this document,
         but you should provide some information about the setup, other charms deployed,
         or other configurations/settings handled by the module.
