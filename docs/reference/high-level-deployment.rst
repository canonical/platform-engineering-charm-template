High-level overview of __charm_name__ deployment
=================================================

The following diagram shows a typical deployment of the __charm_name__ charm.

.. 
   Provide a brief description of the deployment here. Is it a Kubernetes cloud, a VM, or both?
   What other charms are included in this deployment? 

.. Include a Mermaid diagram of the charm deployment here. 
   Use one container per charm; the point of this high-level overview is to show
   a typical deployment and not provide a detailed breakdown of any of the charms.
   Provide a brief description of the relations (for instance, "provides connection",
   "caches storage", or "provides database"). More information on how to create mermaid diagrams
   can be found in https://canonical-platform-engineering.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/engineering-practices/documentation/architecture-diagram-guidance/
