Security overview
=================

.. TODO: Remember to update this file for your charm!!
         Elaborate on topics such as common risks, good practices, built-in protection, etc.
         Are there upstream security docs that we can point to? If so, include a
         sentence like:
         For details regarding upstream __charm_name__ configuration and broader security
         considerations, please refer to the upstream documentation (include a link here).

         In most cases, it will be appropriate to include a specific heading for risks.
         Include a subheading for best practices for the user to follow to avoid or limit risks.

         In some cases a product will have particular information security implications
         (concerned with potential for information loss, incorrect retention, unlawful disclosure
         and so on). Notes on these should be gathered separately in the overview topic, or
         in a topic of their own.

This document outlines the security design of the __charm_name__  charm along common risks
and best practices.
